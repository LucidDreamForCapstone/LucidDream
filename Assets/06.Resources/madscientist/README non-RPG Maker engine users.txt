EXPANDED TILESETS

--files in the format *-square.png--

These tilesets are designed to be used in non-RPG Maker engines and tools like Tiled, Unity, Unreal and more.  

They're originally derived from special "autotiles" that would automatically adjust edges, shadows, etc as you draw in RPG Maker.  However, most engines don't support the same format, if they support autotiles at all.  These tiles offer the opportunity to get the same look in your game engine whether or not it accepts special tiles.  The configuration creates the edges for every possible tile combo we could think of.

Yes, they are big.  Yes, there are duplicates (they're made on a template).  Yes, they waste some tile space.  We originally created a "packed" tileset, but it was difficult to see, and nearly impossible to pick out the right interior corners.  It was a misery to use because the somewhat realistic texture caused everything to blend together.

So, in the interest of making the tilesets user-friendly, we decided it was better to leave some "breathing room" and make intuitive shapes to follow.  Even if your engine requires that you create your own tileset, it will help you decide what tiles you want to keep and throw away.  

Feel free to pack and edit the tiles in any way you choose, we don't care as long as you don't post the edits publicly.
