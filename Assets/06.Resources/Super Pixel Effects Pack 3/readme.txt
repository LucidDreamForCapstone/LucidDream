Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

Hello! Thank you for downloading the Super Pixel Effects Pack 3 asset pack. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and understand this zip file.

- In the root folder, you will find folders named PNG and spritesheet.

- The PNG folder contains all the effect animations separated into their own folders, with the frames as individual PNG files.

- The spritesheet folder contains all the effect animations separated into their own folders, but with the frames packed into a single image. A metadata file is alongside each spritesheet which may be used to parse the image.

- Recommended animation FPS: 15 (66.7 ms/frame)
